                        Hi, my name is Les Orchard
                        
                        {computer,web,mad} scientist
                        
                        I’ve been a computer nerd since the 80’s, when I was a
                        hyper kid whose attention could only be held for long
                        periods of time by a keyboard and a glowing CRT
                        
                        I found the web when I was in college in the 90’s
                        
                        These days I like tinkering with random gadgets and
                        electronics and blinking things
                          
                        {tech,scifi} writer
                        
                        I’ve gotten a few tech books published. I write little
                        scifi stories, maybe I’ll do more someday

                        I’ve been there since 2008, 6 years as of May, longest
                        I’ve been at any job.

                            - App is short for "application".

                            - But, there's a reason why we have a special word
                            that's caught on.
                            
                            - Apps are a shortening of the very idea of
                            applications.
                            
                            - It's like buying a single instead of the whole album. 
                            
                            - I took that notion from Ian Bogost -

                        Apps tend to be focused on a single task

                        Apps tend to have UI simplified for mobile and touch
                        and smaller screens
                        
                        Apps tend to accommodate limited attention
                        
                        Apps tend to cost $1 or $5 or maybe $10, but that's
                        pushing it
                        
                        Anyone remember the $50 Wolfram Alpha app that came
                        out in Fall 2009?  - By spring 2010 it was $2
                            
                        And actually, if you remember even farther back,
                        PalmOS had apps. But, they sold for prices anywhere
                        from $10 to $100

                            Apple owns iOS and the underlying APIs &amp; frameworks

                            - This translates into a captive App Store audience
                            and taking a 30% cut.

                            - Apple also restricts what you can buy and install
                            based on where you are in the world - If you're
                            outside the US, you might be out of luck.
                            
                            - That’s not to say you get nothing. The App Store
                            is an undeniably effective machine for marketing
                            and distributing iOS apps.
                            
                            - But, it's also the only way to market &amp;
                            distribute iOS apps.
                            
                            - And iOS apps only work on Apple devices.

                            Google's Android is nifty, and it's published as open
                            source. That's not bad.

                            Like Apple, Google takes a 30% cut of apps sold
                            through the Play Store - And, again, you get
                            marketing and distribution help.
                            
                            Android works on many vendors' devices - you can
                            even install an alternative App Store from Amazon.
                            
                            That's all miles better than Apple, IMO.
                            
                            But, and I'm really sorry if this sounds like FUD,
                            there are catches that worry me:

                            - For example, Android software runs on Dalvik. 
                            - Dalvik is a reimplementation of Java.
                            - They call it a "cleanroom" reimplementation, but
                            that's in dispute.
                            - Java is not entirely a free and open industry
                            standard.
                            
                            - Java has complex licensing. Some of it is under
                            the GPL. Some of it is not. Sun Microsystems wanted
                            to encourage Java's spread, yet still have ways to
                            tap in and make money.
                            
                            - These days, Oracle owns Java. They disagree that
                            Google should be free to employ a clone of Java

                            Apple &amp; Google &amp; Oracle are big companies,
                            so they can fight this out.

                            We exist to bring an open and free and user-centric
                            internet to everyone
                             
                            - Since anyone can implement the web, no single
                            party can control it.
                            
                            - Mozilla's goal is to keep it that way

                            - Firefox exists to be at least one of many
                            independent implementations.

                            - We fight to keep proprietary technologies - like
                            patent encumbered video codecs - from becoming
                            essential components of the web We don't always
                            win, but we fight.
                            
                            - Firefox OS was created, in part, to carry that
                            mission onto mobile devices.

                            - You know, the web is 25 years old in 2014!
                            http://www.webat25.org/

                            - The Mozilla Project turned 16 this year, and the
                            Mozilla Foundation will be 11 in July
                                
                            - So, that's a long history of technology and
                            source code out in the open.

                            - Now, of course, I'd be dumb not to admit that
                            some of those 25 years were full of hacks, blind
                            alleys, and total blunders. But, we've learned
                            quite a lot along the way about how to build
                            software for a distributed world-wide-web.

                            - But we've had 25 years to build frameworks and
                            address scaling and all those mistakes along the
                            way have produced wisdom that's now embedded in our
                            code.

                            - In fact, at this conference, you'll find a lot of
                            folks talking about the latest &amp; greatest of
                            this stuff. So, I won't waste too much time
                            enumerating the state of the art.

                            - Remember back when the iPhone first came out?
                            Steve Jobs said iPhone apps were web apps

                            - These things are as valid now as they were back
                            in 2007. (There's more to say about this slide, but
                            I'll get to that in a few minutes.)

                            - But, on the Open Web, you don't need a
                            gatekeeper. Just come to my site and you're running
                            my code, from anywhere in the world.

                            - Most iOS and Android apps require a full
                            redownload to install a new version.

                            - Some larger games only ship a patcher to the
                            store and do their own resource management
                            internally

                            - I mean, I guess that's better than buying CDs at
                            the mall and using a Palm HotSync cradle to install
                            apps.
                            
                            - On the web, you don't need to download the whole
                            thing, just fetch the code updates you need. You
                            can do this with individual resources, or bundle
                            things up.

                            - Remember emerging markets and low bandwidth?

                            - The web has mechanisms for caching and offline
                            access - That's like the #1 question I hear.

                            One of the goals is to get a capable smartphone
                            into the hands of people who still use these old
                            phones, at the same price point.

                            Aren't we screwed if Google or Apple comes in?

                            No, actually then we've won. We'd like the
                            smartphone market to be fabulous, too.

                            There are devices for Firefox OS. 
                        
                            In fact, first device was launched last July (2013).

                            And now, I think we're up to at least 7 operator
                            partners, 3 hardware partners. At least, that's
                            what I've seen lately from my colleagues'
                            presentations.

                            Not to be a hipster, but you probably haven't heard
                            of any of them, because they're pretty much all
                            released outside the US.

                        <strong>then why isn’t Apple using this

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Now, there's an elephant in the room. The web wasn't
                        ready for apps. 

                        Everything John Gruber says here was true about the web
                        of 2007.
                        
                        But, before the iPhone, there was precedent for web
                        apps. In 2005, Apple introduced the Dashboard for OS,
                        full of little web-based widgets that in retrospect
                        look suspiciously like apps.

                        And with regard to the web, Apple introduced the Canvas
                        element for WebKit back in 2004. That let us do things
                        like draw clock hands in Dashboard widgets - that was
                        mindblowing back then.

                        Other browser vendors like Mozilla followed their lead
                        and added Canvas support too.

                        So, when the iPhone arrived (and I was still poking
                        around on my PalmOS phone) I thought we were headed for
                        an interesting world where Dashboard widgets - and
                        coincidentally the web - would get levelled up.

                        But then, in less than a year, Apple departed from the
                        web strategy and released a Cocoa-based SDK. 
                        
                        And as a web-head I was sad. I don't have any inside
                        dirt at Apple, but I feel like someone lost an
                        argument.

                        But it's understandable: Levelling up the web is a
                        lot of work that doesn't promise a profit along the
                        way. In contrast, it's obvious that Cocoa Touch and the
                        App Store has been wildly successful for Apple.

                        But, Mozilla and other Open Web friends (some actually
                        working for Apple) took these failings as challenges.
                        Today, none of John Gruber's criticisms remain true.

                        And, in fact, Firefox OS is the ultimate response to
                        the final point: Every app in Firefox OS is built using
                        web technology.

                        But, there's still a lot of work left to do.
