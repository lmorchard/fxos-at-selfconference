                        Hi, my name is Les Orchard
                        
                        {computer,web,mad} scientist
                        
                        I’ve been a computer nerd since the 80’s, when I was a
                        hyper kid whose attention could only be held for long
                        periods of time by a keyboard and a glowing CRT
                        
                        I found the web when I was in college in the 90’s
                        
                        These days I like tinkering with random gadgets and
                        electronics and blinking things
                          
                        {tech,scifi} writer
                        
                        I’ve gotten a few tech books published. I write little
                        scifi stories, maybe I’ll do more someday

                        I make beer and I roast coffee

                        I’ve been there since 2008, 6 years as of May, longest
                        I’ve been at any job.

                            We exist to bring an open and free and user-centric
                            internet to everyone
                             
                            - Since anyone can implement the web, no single
                            party can control it.
                            
                            - Mozilla's goal is to keep it that way

                            - Firefox exists to be at least one of many
                            independent implementations.

                            - We fight to keep proprietary technologies - like
                            patent encumbered video codecs - from becoming
                            essential components of the web We don't always
                            win, but we fight.
                            
                            - Firefox OS was created, in part, to carry that
                            mission onto mobile devices.

                            still really like it.)

                            - App is short for "application".

                            - But, there's a reason why we have a special word
                            that's caught on.
                            
                            - Apps are a shortening of the very idea of
                            applications.
                            
                            - It's like buying a single instead of the whole album.

                        Apps tend to be focused on a single task

                        Apps tend to have UI simplified for mobile and touch
                        and smaller screens
                        
                        Apps tend to accommodate limited attention
                        
                        Apps tend to cost $1 or $5 or maybe $10, but that's
                        pushing it
                        
                        Anyone remember the $50 Wolfram Alpha app that came
                        out in Fall 2009?  - By spring 2010 it was $2
                            
                        And actually, if you remember even farther back,
                        PalmOS had apps. But, they sold for prices anywhere
                        from $10 to $100

                            Apple owns iOS and the underlying APIs &amp; frameworks

                            - This translates into a captive App Store audience
                            and taking a 30% cut.

                            - Apple also restricts what you can buy and install
                            based on where you are in the world - If you're
                            outside the US, you might be out of luck.
                            
                            - That’s not to say you get nothing. The App Store
                            is an undeniably effective machine for marketing
                            and distributing iOS apps.
                            
                            - But, it's also the only way to market &amp;
                            distribute iOS apps.
                            
                            - And iOS apps only work on Apple devices.

                            Google's Android is nifty, and it's published as open
                            source. That's not bad.

                            Like Apple, Google takes a 30% cut of apps sold
                            through the Play Store - And, again, you get
                            marketing and distribution help.
                            
                            Android works on many vendors' devices - you can
                            even install an alternative App Store from Amazon.
                            
                            That's all miles better than Apple, IMO.
                            
                            But, and I'm really sorry if this sounds like FUD,
                            there are catches that worry me:

                            - For example, Android software runs on Dalvik. 
                            - Dalvik is a reimplementation of Java.
                            - They call it a "cleanroom" reimplementation, but
                            that's in dispute.
                            - Java is not entirely a free and open industry
                            standard.
                            
                            - Java has complex licensing. Some of it is under
                            the GPL. Some of it is not. Sun Microsystems wanted
                            to encourage Java's spread, yet still have ways to
                            tap in and make money.
                            
                            - These days, Oracle owns Java. They disagree that
                            Google should be free to employ a clone of Java
                            without paying a great deal of money for it.

                            - http://www.itworld.com/mobile-wireless/278559/java-creator-unhappy-oracle-trial-outcome

                            Apple &amp; Google &amp; Oracle are big companies,
                            so they can fight this out. 

                            - But, personally, I hate feeling like my career
                            &amp; industry is underfoot for those fights.

                            - Remember back when the iPhone first came out?
                            Steve Jobs said iPhone apps *were* web apps

                            - These things are as valid now as they were back
                            in 2007.

                            - On the Open Web, you don't need a
                            gatekeeper. Just come to my site and you're running
                            my code, from anywhere in the world.

                            - That's called Code on Demand

                            - Most iOS and Android apps require a full
                            redownload to install a new version.

                            - Some larger games only ship a patcher to the
                            store and do their own resource management
                            internally

                            - I mean, I guess that's better than buying CDs at
                            the mall and using a Palm HotSync cradle to install
                            apps.
                            
                            - On the web, you don't need to download the whole
                            thing, just fetch the code updates you need. You
                            can do this with individual resources, or bundle
                            things up.

                            - Remember emerging markets and low bandwidth?

                            - The web has mechanisms for caching and offline
                            access - That's like the #1 question I hear.

                            - The Mozilla Project turned 16 this year, and the
                            Mozilla Foundation will be 11 in July
                                
                            - So, that's a long history of technology and
                            source code out in the open.

                            - Now, of course, I'd be dumb not to admit that
                            some of those 25 years were full of hacks, blind
                            alleys, and total blunders. But, we've learned
                            quite a lot along the way about how to build
                            software for a distributed world-wide-web.

                            - But we've had 25 years to build frameworks and
                            address scaling and all those mistakes along the
                            way have produced wisdom that's now embedded in our
                            code.

                            - In fact, at this conference, you'll find a lot of
                            folks talking about the latest &amp; greatest of
                            this stuff. So, I won't waste too much time
                            enumerating the state of the art.

                            Now, of course, back in 2007, the web wasn't ready
                            for apps. 

                            Everything John Gruber says here was true about the web
                            of 2007.

                            Web apps didn't work offline.

                            They didn't have local data storage.

                            And they didn't easily appear on anyone's home
                            screen, iPhone or otherwise.
                            
                            <!--
                            But, before the iPhone, there was precedent for web
                            apps. In 2005, Apple introduced the Dashboard for OS,
                            full of little web-based widgets that in retrospect
                            look suspiciously like apps.

                            And with regard to the web, Apple introduced the Canvas
                            element for WebKit back in 2004. That let us do things
                            like draw clock hands in Dashboard widgets - that was
                            mindblowing back then.

                            Other browser vendors like Mozilla followed their lead
                            and added Canvas support too.

                            So, when the iPhone arrived (and I was still poking
                            around on my PalmOS phone) I thought we were headed for
                            an interesting world where Dashboard widgets - and
                            coincidentally the web - would get levelled up.

                            But then, in less than a year, Apple departed from the
                            web strategy and released a Cocoa-based SDK. 
                            
                            And as a web-head I was sad. I don't have any inside
                            dirt at Apple, but I feel like someone lost an
                            argument.

                            But it's understandable: Levelling up the web is a
                            lot of work that doesn't promise a profit along the
                            way. In contrast, it's obvious that Cocoa Touch and the
                            App Store has been wildly successful for Apple.

                            And, in fact, Firefox OS is the ultimate response to
                            the final point: Every app in Firefox OS is built using
                            web technology.
                            -->

                            But, friends of the Open Web, including Mozilla, took
                            these failings as challenges.

                            HTML5 came around and brought with it a raft-load
                            of new APIs that most of the browser makers started
                            implementing.

                            Now, web apps *do* work offline and they *do* have
                            local data storage.

                            And, in fact, they now have access to all sorts of
                            capabilities like multimedia, 2D &amp; 3D graphics,
                            as well as a growing array of ways to communicate
                            over the web.
                            
                            But, there's still a lot of work left to do.

                            on home screens?

                            It's not super obvious or well supported, but
                            you've been able to turn a browser bookmark into a
                            home screen icon for some time now.
                            
                            Apple even established the apple-touch-icon HTML
                            link relation for specifying what that icon should
                            look like.
                            
                            But really that's the bare minimum of what you need
                            to "install" a web app: It's a bookmark.

                            But, there's definitely room for improvement.

                            So, this is what we're calling an "Open Web App Manifest".

                            It's a JSON file that lives on your web server at a
                            public URL, and it declares a bunch of metadata
                            about an app.

                            These are some of the basics, like: Name,
                            description, the home page, some icons, and some
                            details on the developer.

                            There's a lot more that can go in here, like
                            requested permissions and such. But, I'll get to
                            that in a bit.

                            You can put this in your own page, and wire it up
                            to an "Install Now" button. This is Mozilla's
                            answer to "Add to home screen".

                            This is marketplace.firefox.com, the default app
                            marketplace for Firefox OS.

                            This is also all open source, based on open APIs.
                            You can build your own, if you wanted to.

                            Unfortunately, that does not so far include iOS.

                            It does include Windows, but I forgot to take a

                            Well, there's still a lot more work to do.

                            It turns out that smartphones and tablets and
                            laptops have grown a lot of interesting

                            They've got accelerometers and compasses and
                            multiple radios and touch screens and... well we're

                            for a "deviceorientation" event.

                            as the rate of rotation on those axes.
